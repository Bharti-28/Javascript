/* We have data types now but we have to store it somewhere, so we use variables and constants

variables - that can change anytime
decare - var
         let

rules - 
letters - first should be letters hi, hello n123 valid but 1n23 not valid
underscore - _age valid
dollersign - $age valid

constants - cannot change, no matter what
declare - const

whatever you assigned value its stores in your RAM Memory, we cannot see or read the value in RAM cause its 
only machine readable and in 0-1 values

keywords - var, const are keywords that defined by js itself

identifiers - var names name, age are identifiers
*/

// var name = "bharti"
// var age = "20"

const hi = "bharti"
const hello = "20"

/* how to print 
*/

console.log(name);
console.log(age);

const hey = "null"
const bye = "undefined"

hey = "changed"  //we can not repeat constants it wont work
hey = "again changed"
