//Template literals is the concept of new javascrip of ES6

//ES6 is Ecma Script which is the new version of javascript


var bharti = "hi"; //we know that within single/double quotes we can write string data types
var bharti = "hello" + " " + "bharti"
const hello =`hey`;  //its embbed javascript code easily in string type


var bharti = "hello" + " " + "bharti" //in this exa. if we want space we have to make it space there by join string
// console.log(bharti);

//But

//with the template literals you can easily

var bharti = `hello bharti` //whatever you want you can directly write with space here help of the backtick
// console.log(bharti);

var bharti =`hello ${hello}`; //you can also directly access variable value using $ and {} sign
console.log(bharti);
